QUICKSTART
==========

To checkout/download this, see `README.md`.

This is an intermediate file to explain you how to use this until `./gitstart.sh` springs into existence explaining things interactively.

One-time commands
-----------------

You only need those one single time (or after updating gitstart).

- `./aliases.sh` adds some hopefully interesting aliases to your GIT.  The `up` comes from me being an old CVS veteran used to abuse `cvs up` to list the current status.

- `./fix-bashrc.sh` adds __git_ps1 to your .bashrc such that you can see your branch in the shell prompt.

`$PATH` commands
----------------

Copy those into a directory which is found by `$PATH`, probably, as you need to call them from a a repository.

- `gitstart-add.sh` adds an SSH deployment key which can be added to your GITHUB repository.
